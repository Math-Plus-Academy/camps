<%= @registration.parent_name %>,

PLEASE READ!

This is a reminder that <%= @registration.student_first_name %> is registered for
the following camp(s) next week at Math Plus:
<% @registration.camp_offerings.each do |offering| %>
  <% if offering.start_date > Date.today && offering.start_date < Date.today + 7.days %>
    - <%= offering.confirmation_name %>
    <% if offering.camp_id == 2 %>
      *It will be helpful if your student either has, or has access to an Gmail account.
      This is only necessary for the Web Design Camp. We will be setting them up with
      an account on a coding website and are planning to do some work with Google Docs.
    <% end %>
  <% end %>
<% end %>

Additional things to note:

-Full-day and AM camps start at 9 AM and PM camps start at 12:30 PM

-If your student is registered for a full-day camp or two half-day camps they will
need to bring a packed lunch. Lunch will not be provided.

-We will be providing healthy snacks periodically throughout all camps.

-There is no need to arrive early or bring anything with you (aside from a lunch for
all-day campers).

-Please mark your calendar to pick your child up about 20 minutes early on the
last day for a short presentation of what they've learned.
