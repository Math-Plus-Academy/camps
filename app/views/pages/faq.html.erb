  <h3>How do I register more than one child for camps?</h3>
  <p>You must enroll each child separately. Once you've completed your first registration, you'll see a button to enroll another child.</p>

  <h3>My child did robotics camp last year, can he/she do it again?</h3>
  <p>This year, we've completely redesigned out robotics curriculum so that students who've done it in the past, can do it again and get a whole new experience.</p>

  <h3>Whatâ€™s the difference between LEGO engineering &amp; LEGO robotics</h3>
  <p>The LEGO engineering camp is a perfect fit for younger kids (ages 6 - 8) that love LEGOs and science. They will learn about simple machines like levers and pulleys and much, much more.<br /> LEGO Robotics is for older students (ages 9 - 14) and incorporates the LEGO Mindstorms NXT and EV3 robots. Students build and program robots to complete fun challenges.</p>

  <h3>What's the difference between Programming with SCRATCH and Video Game Design?</h3>
  <p>Both camps will focus on using software to create games and animations. SCRATCH camp is a better for kids who really want to learn to code. Video game design campers will not do programming, but will get to exercise their creativity to create professional quality games by the end of the week.</p>

  <h3>Do you offer more advanced programming camps</h3>
  <p>For students that want to go beyond SCRATCH programming, we recommend they join our ongoing programming labs. <a href="/classes/computer-programming">Click here to learn more about Programming Lab</a></p>

  <h3>I want my child to get ahead in math this summer, but I don't see math camps for my child's ability</h3>
  <p>With the exception of KG and pre-algebra, we are not offering math camps this year. We recommend you enroll in weekly math classes to really boost your child's confidence and enjoyment of math this summer. <a href="/book-assessment">Book a Complimentary Asssment</a> to find out which of our classes would be the best fit for your child this summer.</p>
